	<p>Click a question below to reveal the answer.</p>
	

	[accordion title="How long does an HVAC system typically last?"]
		 <p>On average, HVAC systems last between 10 and 20 years. The amount of time you can expect from your HVAC will vary greatly depending on the specific model, how often you have it serviced, how often you change the air filter, and your specific usage patterns.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="Why is my air conditioner blowing warm air?"]
		 <p>If your air conditioner is blowing warm air, it could be due to several reasons. The most common causes include a dirty air filter, low refrigerant levels, a malfunctioning thermostat, or issues with the outside unit.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What does it mean if my furnace is making a strange noise?"]
		 <p>Unusual noises from your furnace could indicate a mechanical problem, airflow reductions, or a clogged burner. If you are experiencing this, call [get-biz info="name"] at [get-biz info="phone-link"] and let us assess the situation as soon as possible to prevent potential damage or failure of the system.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="Why is my HVAC system constantly running?"]
		 <p>An HVAC system that is constantly running can be a symptom of a few different problems, such as a thermostat set to "continuous run" mode, a system that is too small for the space it is cooling or heating, or a possible malfunction that needs professional attention.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="How often should I have my HVAC system serviced?"]
		 <p>At [get-biz info="name"], we recommended that you have your HVAC system serviced twice per year, ideally in the spring before the summer heat, and in the fall before the winter cold sets in.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="Why is regular HVAC maintenance important?"]
		 <p>Regular HVAC maintenance helps keep your system running efficiently, which can save you money on energy bills. It can also prolong the life of the system, prevent costly repairs or breakdowns, and ensure a healthy and comfortable indoor environment.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="My energy bills have skyrocketed. Could this be related to my HVAC system?"]
		 <p>Yes, a sudden increase in your energy bills could indicate that your HVAC system is not running efficiently. This could be due to a number of factors, such as a dirty or clogged filter, leaks in your ductwork, or a system that is nearing the end of its lifespan. [get-biz info="name"] would be happy to come out and take a look, and give you our recommendation.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="How often should I change my HVAC filter?"]
		 <p>The frequency with which you should change your HVAC filter depends on the type of filter, the air quality in your area, and if there are pets in the home. However, a good rule of thumb is to check it once a month and replace it at least every 3 months.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What are the signs I may need a new HVAC system?"]
		 <p> If your HVAC system is over 15 years old, requires frequent repairs, struggles to maintain a comfortable temperature, or is resulting in unusually high energy bills, it might be time to consider a replacement.  Call [get-biz info="name"] at [get-biz info="phone-link"] and ask us about a free quote on a new high-efficiency system.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="Can I perform my own HVAC repairs?"]
		 <p>While small maintenance tasks such as changing filters or cleaning your outdoor unit can be done yourself, most HVAC repairs involve complex machinery that requires professional training to service properly. Attempting to perform your own repairs could potentially be dangerous and usually voids any existing warranties.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What is the ideal temperature to set my thermostat at during the summer and winter?"]
		 <p>The ideal temperature setting can vary based on personal comfort, but generally, 78° in the summer and 68° in the winter are recommended to balance comfort with energy efficiency.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What is a SEER rating?"]
		 <p>SEER stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. It measures the cooling efficiency of your air conditioner or heat pump. A higher SEER rating means greater energy efficiency. In order to receive the benefits of a higher SEER rating, you must upgrade the entire system. [get-biz info="name"] will be happy to custom design an air conditioning and heating system that fits your needs and budget.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What is the difference between a central air system and a heat pump?"]
		 <p>A central air system only cools or heats the air, while a heat pump can do both. In the winter, a heat pump pulls heat from the outside air to warm your home. In the summer, it pulls heat from your home to cool it.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="Why is my HVAC system freezing up?"]
		 <p>Your HVAC system can freeze up due to a lack of airflow from a dirty filter or ductwork, low refrigerant, or the system being run when the outside temperature is too cold.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What size HVAC system do I need for my home?"]
		 <p>The size of your HVAC system depends on a variety of factors including the total square footage of your home, the type and quality of insulation, the number and type of windows, and even the number of people living in the home. [get-biz info="name"] would be happy to conduct a load calculation to determine the right size for your home.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What is HVAC zoning?"]
		 <p>HVAC zoning involves dividing your home into different areas or "zones," each controlled by its own thermostat. This allows for more precise control of temperature and airflow throughout your home, potentially saving energy and improving comfort.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="Can a smart thermostat really save me money?"]
		 <p>Yes, a smart thermostat can save you money by allowing you to schedule temperature changes based on when you\'ll be home, away, or asleep. Some models can even learn your habits and adjust accordingly to maximize efficiency.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What are some signs of poor indoor air quality?"]
		 <p>Signs of poor indoor air quality can include persistent headaches, fatigue, dizziness, coughing, sneezing, and eye, nose, or throat irritation. If you notice these symptoms are worse at home and improve when you leave, it might be a sign of poor indoor air quality.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="How can I improve my home\'s indoor air quality?"]
		 <p>Regularly replacing your HVAC filters, scheduling routine maintenance, and installing air purifiers can all help improve your home\'s air quality. Additionally, controlling humidity and ensuring proper ventilation can also make a big difference.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What is a ductless mini-split system?"]
		 <p>A ductless mini-split system is a type of HVAC system that doesn\'t require ductwork. It consists of an outdoor compressor unit and one or more indoor air handling units. They can be a good option for home additions or places where installing ductwork isn\'t practical.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What is refrigerant and what does it do in my HVAC system?"]
		 <p>Refrigerant is a special fluid in your HVAC system that absorbs heat from the air in your home and releases it outside. If your system is low on refrigerant, it won\'t cool your home as efficiently.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="What is the difference between a single-stage and a two-stage HVAC system?"]
		 <p>A single-stage HVAC system operates at full capacity whenever it\'s on, while a two-stage system can operate at both full and partial capacity. Two-stage systems are generally more efficient because they don\'t use as much energy on mild days when full capacity isn\'t needed.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="How do I know if I have a leak in my ductwork?"]
		 <p>Signs of a ductwork leak can include unusually high energy bills, rooms that are difficult to heat or cool, and dusty air immediately after the system starts.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="Can I just replace the outdoor unit on an older HVAC system to save money?"]
		 <p>While it might seem like a cost-saving measure, mismatching a new outdoor unit with an older indoor unit can lead to efficiency problems and potentially cause the new unit to fail sooner. [get-biz info="name"] generally recommends that the entire system is replaced at once.</p>
	[/accordion]
	

	[accordion title="How can I reduce strain on my HVAC system?"]
		 <p>Regular maintenance, changing or cleaning filters regularly, ensuring proper insulation, using ceiling fans to circulate air, and keeping vents unblocked can all help reduce strain on your HVAC system.</p>

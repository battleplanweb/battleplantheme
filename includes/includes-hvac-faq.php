	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

	<p>Click a question below to reveal the answer.</p>

	[accordion title="How does my A/C system work?"]
		 <p>Your air conditioning system is actually designed with two separate units which perform together to provide you the ultimate comfort you deserve. The unit on the outside of your home contains a liquid refrigerant that is distributed over the coil located indoors. Through this process,the heat and humidity are removed from the air and your comfort is maintained by cooling the house.</p>
	[/accordion]

	[accordion title="What does SEER mean?"]
		 <p>The efficiency of a heating and cooling system is calculated by utilizing a ratio standard referred to as Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER). Governmental standards state that the SEER of any air conditioning system must meet a minimum of 13 SEER as enacted in 1992. An A/C system that is considered to be “high efficient” must be between 15-20 “SEER”. In order to receive the benefits of a 13 SEER or higher, you must upgrade the entire system.

	[accordion title="What factors contribute to my home\'s comfort levels?"]
	   <p>There are four contributing factors that play a vital role to the efficiency of your air conditioning and heating system.</p>
	   <ul>
		<li><b>Temperature:</b> To the average consumer, temperature is typically the beginning and the end of discussion when the topic of indoor comfort arises. However, temperature is actually just the beginning. At [get-biz info="name"], we will recommend a heating and cooling system customized to your needs.</li>
		<li><b>Clean and Fresh Air:</b> A dusty home can have disastrous effects on both the efficiency of your heating and cooling system and your health. Our specialists at [get-biz info="name"] will be happy to suggest an air purifier that will assist to remove the dust and other allergens within your homes air so that not only will you and your family breath easier but your system will also have the opportunity to run more effectively.</li>
		<li><b>Humidity:</b> During the winter months, the air is very dry which causes static electricity and itchy skin. If humidity is added, the uncomfortable feelings of dry skin is relieved. In the summer months, if the humidity is removed, the air becomes less sticky and the summer becomes more enjoyable.</li>
		<li><b>System Control:</b> On a daily basis we seem to always answer the same question. Why are the temperatures so inconsistent from room to room? The front of the house is warmer or cooler than the back and vice versa. Why?? Your answer to that question is a self-adjusting thermostat will balance the air throughout your home and provide an even distribution of air throughout the home. Our specialists at [get-biz info="name"] will be happy to suggest a programmable thermostat designed for your needs.</li>

	[accordion title="What causes a condensation leak problem?"]
	   <p>The evaporator or cooling coil is located in the unit inside the home. As it creates condensation by removing moisture from the air, a drain pan will normally collect the water. If the drain line becomes clogged, a leak occurs from the overflow. Factors that lead to a clog in a drain line include algae build-up, crimped lines, settled wood platforms, snakes or other animals or just poor system maintenance.</p>
	[/accordion]

	[accordion title="Why are my indoor coils, pipes or compressor covered with ice?"]
	   <p>There are two reasons why ice would be found on coils, pipes, etc. The first being a low level of refrigerant or a clogged air filter. If the problem is not corrected as soon as possible, it could have disastrous effects on the compressor of the system. Should you notice freezing, you should first turn the system off, check and change the air filter and if the air filter is not clogged, then immediately consult our professionals at [get-biz info="name"]. We will promptly be at your service to resolve your freezing problem.</p>
	[/accordion]

	[accordion title="What can be done to make my home\'s air cleaner?"]
	  <p>Ensuring your home has the proper ventilation can reduce moisture levels, which can greatly increase indoor air quality. Salt lamps, activated charcoal and houseplants have been found to naturally purify indoor air. Your carpets are a toxic sponge, and should be cleaned regularly.  Avoid smoking and using chemicals in the air.  And finally, the best way to improve your indoor air quality is to install a whole house air filtration system.  Our system can remove up to 99.98% of airborne allergens from your air.</p>
	[/accordion]

	[accordion title="How often should my filters be cleaned or replaced?"]
	  <p>It is recommended to inspect your filters at least once each month. Cleaning and replacement should be done on an as needed basis. As with the rest of your heating and cooling system, cleaner is always better.</p>
	[/accordion]

	[accordion title="Why should I consider a new high-efficiency filter?"]
	  <p>High-efficiency filters remove more of the smaller particles from the air. This will help us breathe better and reduce sinus problems, headaches and colds. Many people miss fewer days from school and work and use less allergy medication. The air is filtered before entering the air conditioning and furnace.</p>
	[/accordion]

	[accordion title="How much am I overpaying on utility bills?"]
	  <p>For any system that is in excess of 10 years old, unfortunately you are paying an average of 30% more on your overall utility expenses due to a lack in efficiency standard. For example, by upgrading a unit which has a 10 SEER rating to a new updated system with a minimum of 13 SEER, you will see a savings of at least 30%. An important point to remember is that when you upgrade to a 13 SEER or higher, you must install an ARI matched system.</p>
	[/accordion]

	[accordion title="How often should my system be checked?"]
	  <p>In able to ensure your system maintains a maximum operating standard, our experts at [get-biz info="name"] recommend a thorough check-up at least twice a year. In doing so, we have designed our preventative maintenance agreement that will do exactly that! Our preventative maintenance agreement will provide two scheduled visits each year.</p>
